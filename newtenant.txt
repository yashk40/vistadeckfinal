# White Label / Multi-Tenant Setup Guide

This application is designed to be easily repurposed for different businesses (Interior Design, Furniture Store, Portfolio, etc.).

Follow these steps to customize the application for a new tenant:

## 1. Basic Branding & Configuration
Location: `config.ts`

Update the `CONFIG` object to change:
- Company Name & Short Name
- Logo Text & Taglines
- Contact Information (Phone, Email, Address)
- Social Media Links
- Hero Section Text & Image
- Key Stats

## 2. PWA & App Identity
Location: `manifest.json`

Update the following fields:
- `name`: Full app name
- `short_name`: Name shown on home screen
- `description`: SEO description
- `theme_color` & `background_color`: Match brand colors
- `icons`: Replace with new logo assets (ensure sizes match)

Location: `index.html`
- Update `<title>` tag.
- Update `<meta name="theme-color">`.
- Update `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`.

## 3. Visual Theme (Colors & Fonts)
Location: `index.html` (Tailwind Configuration)

The app uses Tailwind CSS with a customized configuration script in the `<head>`.
To change the primary color scheme:
1. Locate the `tailwind.config` script.
2. Update the `colors.primary` object.
   - '50' through '950' values should form a cohesive palette for the new brand.
3. Update `fontFamily` if different fonts are required (ensure fonts are imported via Google Fonts link).

## 4. Content Data
Location: `data.ts`

This file acts as a local database. Update:
- `products`: Store items (Furniture, Decor, etc.)
- `projects`: Portfolio case studies
- `testimonials`: Client reviews
- `features`: Service highlights
- `brochures`: Downloadable resources
- `articles`: Blog/Magazine posts
- `faqs`: Frequently Asked Questions
- `pricingPlans`: Service packages

## 5. Images & Assets
- Replace generic Unsplash URLs in `data.ts` and `config.ts` with actual business assets.
- Ensure images are optimized for web (WebP/JPG) to maintain performance.

## 6. Deployment
- The app is a static SPA (Single Page Application).
- Build the project.
- Host on any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).

## 7. Advanced Customization
- **Feature Toggling**: Components like `Store.tsx` or `Magazine.tsx` can be conditionally rendered in `App.tsx` if a tenant doesn't need them.
- **SEO**: Update meta tags in `index.html` for better search engine visibility.
